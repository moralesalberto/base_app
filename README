= Base App

A rails 3 starter app to place the necessary elements to get an app going
like:

- authentication (devise)
- role authorization (declarative_authorization)
- web-app_theme (neat way to get some styles going)

To get started, you will need three roles

security
  name: security

admin
  name: admin

user
  name: user
